Dependencies
============

Before you can use this project template, you will need to install `Django`_
and `Python`_. Additionally, the `PostgreSQL`_ database engine is used by
default, which in turn requires `psycopg2`_ to work with Python.

.. tip::
    In order to avoid conflicting requirements, it is strongly
    recommended that you create an isolated virtual environment for each of
    your Python projects. Some popular tools for managing virtual environments
    are `venv`_, `virtualenv`_, `virtualenvwrapper`_, and `pipenv`_.

Django and Python
-----------------

* Padjana Start Django |release| is compatible with any Django |version|.x
  release running on Python 3.5.x, 3.6.x, or 3.7.x.
* It is recommended that you install the latest micro release (A.B.C) available
  for your system.

PostgreSQL and psycopg2
-----------------------

* It is recommended that you install the latest minor release (A.B) available
  for your system.
* The installation of psycopg2 is covered in the next step, so you can ignore
  it for now.
